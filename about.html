<h1>SumaQosh - About</h1>
<h2>Know more about me! <h2>

<p>I am an artist who's artwork is mainly inspired by my interests<br> which cover a wide scope of franchises and worlds.</p>
<p>My other goal is to also positively impact other people's lives, whether it be through his artwork or even just<br>sending a nice comment or retweeting other artists' work.</p>
<p>One of my biggest inpirations for the sort of art I make comes from all the underground electronic music I listen to.<br>
Example include music from the genres of colour bass, electro house, progressive house, DNB/Breaks and a good bucnh of other genres. <br>
Check out the music page on here for more details! </p>
